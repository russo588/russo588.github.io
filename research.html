            <h3><small>Joel Rosenfeld, Benjamin Russo, and Warren E. Dixon</small></h3>
            <h3><small>Published in Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications, Volume 463, Issue 2, 15 July 2018, Pages 576-592</small></h3>
            <blockquote>
This paper investigates the function theoretic properties of two reproducing kernel functions based on the Mittag-Leffler function that are related through a composition. Both spaces provide one parameter generalizations of the traditional Bargmann-Fock space. In particular, the Mittag-Leffler space of entire functions yields many similar properties to the Bargmann-Fock space, and several results are demonstrated involving zero sets and growth rates. The second generalization, the Mittag-Leffler space of the slitted plane, is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of functions for which Caputo fractional differentiation and multiplication by $z^q$ (for $q>0$) are densely defined adjoints of one another.</blockquote>

        <h3><small>Published in Operators and Matrices, 2017, Volume 11, Number 2, pp 397–433 </small></h3>
        <blockquote>An operator $T$ is called a $3$-isometry if there exist operators $B_1(T^*,T)$ and $B_2(T^*,T)$ such that
        $$Q(n) = T^{*n}T^{n} = 1 + nB_1(T^*,T)+n^2B_2(T^*,T)$$
        for all natural numbers $n$. An operator $J$ is a Jordan operator of order $2$ if $J=U+N$ where $U$ is unitary, $N$ is nilpotent order $2$, and $U$ and $N$ commute.
        An easy computation shows that $J$ is a $3$-isometry and that the restrictions of $J$ to an invariant subspace is also a $3$-isometry.
        Those $3$-isometries which are the restriction of a Jordan operator to an invariant subspace can be identified, using the theory of completely positive maps, in terms of a positivity condition on the operator pencil $Q(s)$.
        In this article, we establish the analogous result in the multi-variable setting and show, by modifying an example of Choi, that an additional hypothesis is necessary.
        Lastly we discuss the joint spectrum of sub-Jordan tuples and derive the results of $3$-symmetric operators as a corrolary.</blockquote>

        <h3><small>Scott McCullough and Ben Russo</small></h3>
        <h3><small>Published in Integral Equations and Operator Theory, January 2016, Volume 84, Issue 1, pp 69–87</small></h3>
        <blockquote>
            An operator $T$ on Hilbert space is a $3$-isometry if there exist operators $B_1$ and $B_2$ such that $$T^{*n}T^n = I+nB_1 +n^2 B_2.$$
            An operator $J$ is a Jordan operator if it the sum of a unitary $U$ and nilpotent $N$ of order two which commute.
            If $T$ is a $3$-isometry and $c>0$, then $I-c^{-2} B_2 + sB_1 + s^2B_2$ is positive  semidefinite for all real $s$ if and only if it is the restriction of a Jordan operator $J = U + N$
            with the norm of $N$ at most $c$. As a corollary, an analogous result for $3$-symmetric operators, due to
            Helton and Agler, is recovered.

       <h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11792">The Occupation Kernel Method for Nonlinear System Identification</a></h3>
       <h3><small>Joel A. Rosenfeld, Benjamin Russo, Rushikesh Kamalapurkar, Taylor T. Johnson</small></h3>
        <blockquote>
            This manuscript presents a novel approach to nonlinear system identification leveraging densely defined Liouville operators 
            and a new "kernel" function that represents an integration functional over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) dubbed 
            an occupation kernel. The manuscript thoroughly explores the concept of occupation kernels in the contexts of RKHSs of 
            continuous functions, and establishes Liouville operators over RKHS where several dense domains are found for specific 
            examples of this unbounded operator. The combination of these two concepts allow for the embedding of a dynamical system 
            into a RKHS, where function theoretic tools may be leveraged for the examination of such systems. This framework allows
            for trajectories of a nonlinear dynamical system to be treated as a fundamental unit of data for nonlinear system 
            identification routine. The approach to nonlinear system identification is demonstrated to identify parameters of 
            a dynamical system accurately, while also exhibiting a certain robustness to noise.

       <h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09689">Non-commutative disintegrations: existence and uniqueness in finite dimensions</a></h3>
       <h3><small>Arthur J. Parzygnat, Benjamin P. Russo</small></h3>
        <blockquote>
        We utilize category theory to define non-commutative disintegrations, regular conditional probabilities, and optimal hypotheses 
       for finite-dimensional $C^*$-algebras. In the process, we introduce a notion of a.e. equivalence for positive maps and show that 
       the category of $C^*$-algebras and a.e. equivalence classes of 2-positive unital maps forms a category. A related result holds 
       for positive unital maps on von Neumann algebras. In the special case of a finite-dimensional commutative $C^*$-algebra, this 
       reproduces the usual notions of a.e. equivalence and a disintegration of a probability measure over another measure consistent
       with a probability-preserving function. Similar to the commutative (measure-theoretic) case, disintegrations are unique almost
       everywhere whenever they exist. However, in contrast to the commutative case, there are many instances where such disintegrations
       do not exist. We show a certain separability condition on the density matrices representing the states is necessary and sufficient 
       for the existence and uniqueness of such disintegration on finite-dimensional $C^*$-algebras. Physically, tracing out degrees of freedom 
       from the environment of a quantum system is one example of a state-preserving *-homomorphism and the disintegration is the optimal 
       reversal of this procedure. Finally, we discuss some implications for quantum measurement.
