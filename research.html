	            In this paper a streaming weak-SINDy algorithm is developed specifically for compressing streaming scientific data. The production of scientific data, either via simulation or experiments, is undergoing an stage of exponential growth, which makes data compression important and often necessary for storing and utilizing large scientific data sets. As opposed to classical ``offline" compression algorithms that perform compression on a readily available data set, streaming compression algorithms compress data ``online" while the data generated from simulation or experiments is still flowing through the system. This feature makes streaming compression algorithms well-suited for scientific data compression, where storing the full data set offline is often infeasible. This work proposes a new streaming compression algorithm, streaming weak-SINDy, which takes advantage of the underlying data characteristics during compression. The streaming weak-SINDy algorithm constructs feature matrices and target vectors in the online stage via a streaming integration method in a memory efficient manner. The feature matrices and target vectors are then used in the offline stage to build a model through a regression process that aims to recover equations that govern the evolution of the data. For compressing high-dimensional streaming data, we adopt a streaming proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) process to reduce the data dimension and then use the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm to compress the temporal data of the POD expansion. We propose modifications to the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm to accommodate the dynamically updated POD basis. By combining the built model from the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm and a small amount of data samples, the full data flow could be reconstructed accurately at a low memory cost, as shown in the numerical tests.

	            This manuscript introduces a space of functions, termed occupation kernel Hilbertspace (OKHS), that operate on collections of signals ratherthan real or complex functions.  Tosupport this new definition, an explicit class of OKHSs is given through the consideration of a repro-ducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). This space enables the definition of nonlocal operators, suchas fractional order Liouville operators, as well as spectral decomposition methods for correspondingfractional order dynamical systems. In this manuscript, a fractional order DMD routine is presented,and the details of the finite rank representations are given.Significantly, despite the added theoreti-cal content through the OKHS formulation, the resultant computations only differ slightly from thatof occupation kernel DMD methods for integer order systems posed over RKHSs.

	            Conventionally, data driven identification and control problems for higher order dynamical systems are solved by augmenting the system state by the derivatives of the output to formulate first order dynamical systems in higher dimensions. However, solution of the augmented problem typically requires knowledge of the full augmented state, which requires numerical differentiation of the original output, frequently resulting in noisy signals. This manuscript develops the theory necessary for a direct analysis of higher order dynamical systems using higher order Liouville operators. Fundamental to this theoretical development is the introduction of signal valued RKHSs. Ultimately, it is observed that despite the added abstractions, the necessary computations are remarkably similar to that of first order DMD methods using occupation kernels.

	            In this paper three algorithms are developed for the streaming compression of scientific data. The algorithms presented are reliant on the theory of vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and operator valued kernels. The scientific data is modeled as a snapshot of time dependent vector-field $F(x,t)$ over a manifold $M$ and the recovery of the data is framed as a learning problem. These processes are then appropriately modified and analyzed for the streaming scenario in which data is generated without the ability to revisit past entries.

	            Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has become a common technique for constructing surrogate models for dynamical systems from observed system states.
				The Occupation Kernel DMD (OKDMD) method proposed in (Rosenfeld et al., 2022) and (Rosenfeld et al., 2024) is a Liouville operator based method that builds surrogate models from system state trajectories.
				This paper proposes an extension of OKDMD to the case when the system states are observed in a streaming fashion, i.e., only a small faction of the state trajectory is available at a given time. 
				The developed method, Streaming Occupation Kernel DMD (StOKeDMD), accommodates the streaming data input by leveraging properties of specific choices of kernel functions and occupation kernels. 
				We apply the StoKeDMD method as a compression method for streaming data, analyze the memory complexity, and demonstrate the performance of StoKeDMD in the compression of streaming data generated from a Lorenz system and a fluid flow simulation.

				Operator theoretic methods in dynamical system have been dominated by the use of Koopman operators and their continuous time counterparts, such as Koopman Generators and Liouville Operators. The advantage gained from their use primarily stems from the ability to extract subspaces and eigenfunctions  within a space of observables that are invariant with respect to the Koopman operator over that space. When this occurs, a dynamic mode decomposition of the systems state provides a linear model for the dynamical system.

				Not all Koopman operators have eigenfunctions that may be exploited in this manner. However, the framework can still be leveraged for approximations using other operators. In this setting, we present a different operator for the study of dynamical systems, the weighted composition operator. These operators are compact for a wide range of dynamics and spaces, and through their interactions with occupation kernels and vector valued kernels, they admit an estimation of the underlying dynamics.

				This manuscript presents a new algorithm for the data driven study of dynamical systems from data, and also provides two numerical experiments where convergence is achieved as a proof of concept.

	            In this paper, we give an in-depth error analysis for surrogate models generated by a variant of the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method. We start with an overview of a variety of non-linear system identification techniques, namely, SINDy, weak-SINDy, and the occupation kernel method. Under the assumption that the dynamics are a finite linear combination of a set of basis functions, these methods establish a matrix equation to recover coefficients. We illuminate the structural similarities between these techniques and establish a projection property for the weak-SINDy technique. Following the overview, we analyze the error of surrogate models generated by a simplified version of weak-SINDy. In particular, under the assumption of boundedness of a composition operator given by the solution, we show that (i) the surrogate dynamics converges towards the true dynamics and (ii) the solution of the surrogate model is reasonably close to the true solution. Finally, as an application, we discuss the use of a combination of weak-SINDy surrogate modeling and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to build a surrogate model for partial differential equations (PDEs).

	            Reliable operation of automatic systems is heavily dependent on the ability to detect faults in the underlying dynamics. While traditional model-based methods have been widely used for fault detection, data-driven approaches have garnered increasing attention due to their ease of deployment and minimal need for expert knowledge. In this letter, we present a novel principal component analysis (PCA) method that uses occupation kernels. Occupation kernels result in feature maps that are tailored to the measured data, have inherent noise-robustness due to the use of integration, and can utilize irregularly sampled system trajectories of variable lengths for PCA. The occupation kernel PCA method is used to develop a reconstruction error approach to fault detection and its efficacy is validated using numerical simulations.

	            Time-dependent SOLPS-ITER simulations have been used to identify reduced models with the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method and develop model-predictive control of the boundary plasma state using main ion gas puff actuation. A series of gas actuation sequences are input into SOLPS-ITER to produce a dynamic response in upstream and divertor plasma quantities. The SINDy method is applied to identify reduced linear and nonlinear models for the electron density at the outboard midplane $n^{\text{OMP}}_{\text{e,sep}}$ and the electron temperature at the outer divertor $T^{\text{div}}_{\text{e,sep}}$. Note that $T^{\text{div}}_{\text{e,sep}}$ is not necessarily the peak value of $T_{\text{e}}$ along the divertor. The identified reduced models are interpretable by construction (i.e. not black box), and have the form of coupled ordinary differential equations. Despite significant noise in $T^{\text{div}}_{\text{e,sep}}$, the reduced models can be used to predict the response over a range of actuation levels to a maximum deviation of 0.5% in $n^{\text{OMP}}_{\text{e,sep}}$ and 5%–10% in $T^{\text{div}}_{\text{e,sep}}$ for the cases considered. Model retraining using time history data triggered by a preset error threshold is also demonstrated. A model predictive control strategy for nonlinear models is developed and used to perform feedback control of a SOLPS-ITER simulation to produce a setpoint trajectory in $n^{\text{OMP}}_{\text{e,sep}}$ using the integrated plasma simulator framework. The developed techniques are general and can be applied to time-dependent data from other boundary simulations or experimental data. Ongoing work is extending the approach to model identification and control for divertor detachment, which will present transient nonlinear behavior from impurity seeding, including realistic latency and synthetic diagnostic signals derived from the full SOLPS-ITER output.

	            The goal of motion tomography is to recover a description of a vector flow field using information on the trajectory of a sensing unit. In this paper, we develop a predictor corrector algorithm designed to recover vector flow fields from trajectory data with the use of occupation kernels developed by Rosenfeld et al.. Specifically, we use the occupation kernels as an adaptive basis; that is, the trajectories defining our occupation kernels are iteratively updated to improve the estimation on the next stage. Initial estimates are established, then under mild assumptions, such as relatively straight trajectories, convergence is proven using the Contraction Mapping Theorem. We then compare to the established method by Chang et al. by defining a set of error metrics. We found that for simulated data, which provides a ground truth, our method offers a marked improvement and that for a real-world example we have similar results to the established method.

		       Using a diagrammatic reformulation of Bayes' theorem, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of Bayesian inference in the setting of finite-dimensional $C^∗$-algebras. In other words, we prove an analogue of Bayes' theorem in the joint classical and quantum context. Our analogue is justified by recent advances in categorical probability theory, which have provided an abstract formulation of the classical Bayes' theorem. In the process, we further develop non-commutative almost everywhere equivalence and illustrate its important role in non-commutative Bayesian inversion. The construction of such Bayesian inverses, when they exist, involves solving a positive semidefinite matrix completion problem for the Choi matrix. This gives a solution to the open problem of constructing Bayesian inversion for completely positive unital maps acting on density matrices that do not have full support.

	            This manuscript introduces the concept of Liouville operators and occupation kernels over reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). The combination of these two concepts allow for the embedding of a dynamical system into a RKHS, where function theoretic tools may be leveraged for the examination of such systems. These tools are then turned toward the problem of system identification where an inner product formula is developed to provide constraints on the parameters in a system identification setting. This system identification routine is validated through several numerical experiments, where each experiment examines various contributions to the parameter identification error via numerical integration methods and parameters for the kernel functions themselves.

				This paper investigates the function theoretic properties of two reproducing kernel functions based on the Mittag-Leffler function that are related through a composition. Both spaces provide one parameter generalizations of the traditional Bargmann-Fock space. In particular, the Mittag-Leffler space of entire functions yields many similar properties to the Bargmann-Fock space, and several results are demonstrated involving zero sets and growth rates. The second generalization, the Mittag-Leffler space of the slitted plane, is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of functions for which Caputo fractional differentiation and multiplication by $z^q$ (for $q>0$) are densely defined adjoints of one another.

		        An operator $T$ is called a $3$-isometry if there exist operators $B_1(T^*,T)$ and $B_2(T^*,T)$ such that
		        $$Q(n) = T^{*n}T^{n} = 1 + nB_1(T^*,T)+n^2B_2(T^*,T)$$
		        for all natural numbers $n$. An operator $J$ is a Jordan operator of order $2$ if $J=U+N$ where $U$ is unitary, $N$ is nilpotent order $2$, and $U$ and $N$ commute.
		        An easy computation shows that $J$ is a $3$-isometry and that the restrictions of $J$ to an invariant subspace is also a $3$-isometry.
		        Those $3$-isometries which are the restriction of a Jordan operator to an invariant subspace can be identified, using the theory of completely positive maps, in terms of a positivity condition on the operator pencil $Q(s)$.
		        In this article, we establish the analogous result in the multi-variable setting and show, by modifying an example of Choi, that an additional hypothesis is necessary.
		        Lastly we discuss the joint spectrum of sub-Jordan tuples and derive the results of $3$-symmetric operators as a corrolary.
