        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>My research efforts are directed towards a blend of both applied and pure functional analysis with an emphasis on operator theory and function spaces. My work is often cross disciplinary in nature and overlaps heavily with physics and engineering. In addition to my ongoing work in operator theory, I am focused on the development of novel and robust approaches to learning theory in dynamical systems and applications of category theory to quantum probability theory.

	            The goal of motion tomography is to recover a description of a vector flow field using information on the trajectory of a sensing unit. In this paper, we develop a predictor corrector algorithm designed to recover vector flow fields from trajectory data with the use of occupation kernels developed by Rosenfeld et al.. Specifically, we use the occupation kernels as an adaptive basis; that is, the trajectories defining our occupation kernels are iteratively updated to improve the estimation on the next stage. Initial estimates are established, then under mild assumptions, such as relatively straight trajectories, convergence is proven using the Contraction Mapping Theorem. We then compare to the established method by Chang et al. by defining a set of error metrics. We found that for simulated data, which provides a ground truth, our method offers a marked improvement and that for a real-world example we have similar results to the established method.

		       Using a diagrammatic reformulation of Bayes' theorem, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of Bayesian inference in the setting of finite-dimensional $C^âˆ—$-algebras. In other words, we prove an analogue of Bayes' theorem in the joint classical and quantum context. Our analogue is justified by recent advances in categorical probability theory, which have provided an abstract formulation of the classical Bayes' theorem. In the process, we further develop non-commutative almost everywhere equivalence and illustrate its important role in non-commutative Bayesian inversion. The construction of such Bayesian inverses, when they exist, involves solving a positive semidefinite matrix completion problem for the Choi matrix. This gives a solution to the open problem of constructing Bayesian inversion for completely positive unital maps acting on density matrices that do not have full support. We illustrate how the procedure works for several examples relevant to quantum information theory.

	            This manuscript introduces the concept of Liouville operators and occupation kernels over reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). The combination of these two concepts allow for the embedding of a dynamical system into a RKHS, where function theoretic tools may be leveraged for the examination of such systems. These tools are then turned toward the problem of system identification where an inner product formula is developed to provide constraints on the parameters in a system identification setting. This system identification routine is validated through several numerical experiments, where each experiment examines various contributions to the parameter identification error via numerical integration methods and parameters for the kernel functions themselves.

				This paper investigates the function theoretic properties of two reproducing kernel functions based on the Mittag-Leffler function that are related through a composition. Both spaces provide one parameter generalizations of the traditional Bargmann-Fock space. In particular, the Mittag-Leffler space of entire functions yields many similar properties to the Bargmann-Fock space, and several results are demonstrated involving zero sets and growth rates. The second generalization, the Mittag-Leffler space of the slitted plane, is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of functions for which Caputo fractional differentiation and multiplication by $z^q$ (for $q>0$) are densely defined adjoints of one another.

	            This manuscript introduces a space of functions, termed occupation kernel Hilbertspace (OKHS), that operate on collections of signals ratherthan real or complex functions.  Tosupport this new definition, an explicit class of OKHSs is given through the consideration of a repro-ducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). This space enables the definition of nonlocal operators, suchas fractional order Liouville operators, as well as spectral decomposition methods for correspondingfractional order dynamical systems. In this manuscript, a fractional order DMD routine is presented,and the details of the finite rank representations are given.Significantly, despite the added theoreti-cal content through the OKHS formulation, the resultant computations only differ slightly from thatof occupation kernel DMD methods for integer order systems posed over RKHSs.

	            Conventionally, data driven identification and control problems for higher order dynamical systems are solved by augmenting the system state by the derivatives of the output to formulate first order dynamical systems in higher dimensions. However, solution of the augmented problem typically requires knowledge of the full augmented state, which requires numerical differentiation of the original output, frequently resulting in noisy signals. This manuscript develops the theory necessary for a direct analysis of higher order dynamical systems using higher order Liouville operators. Fundamental to this theoretical development is the introduction of signal valued RKHSs. Ultimately, it is observed that despite the added abstractions, the necessary computations are remarkably similar to that of first order DMD methods using occupation kernels.

		       We utilize category theory to define non-commutative disintegrations, regular conditional probabilities, and optimal hypotheses 
		       for finite-dimensional $C^*$-algebras. In the process, we introduce a notion of a.e. equivalence for positive maps and show that 
		       the category of $C^*$-algebras and a.e. equivalence classes of 2-positive unital maps forms a category. A related result holds 
		       for positive unital maps on von Neumann algebras. In the special case of a finite-dimensional commutative $C^*$-algebra, this 
		       reproduces the usual notions of a.e. equivalence and a disintegration of a probability measure over another measure consistent
		       with a probability-preserving function. Similar to the commutative (measure-theoretic) case, disintegrations are unique almost
		       everywhere whenever they exist. However, in contrast to the commutative case, there are many instances where such disintegrations
		       do not exist. We show a certain separability condition on the density matrices representing the states is necessary and sufficient 
		       for the existence and uniqueness of such disintegration on finite-dimensional $C^*$-algebras. Physically, tracing out degrees of freedom 
		       from the environment of a quantum system is one example of a state-preserving *-homomorphism and the disintegration is the optimal 
		       reversal of this procedure. Finally, we discuss some implications for quantum measurement.
